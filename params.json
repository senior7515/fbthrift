{"name":"Fbthrift","tagline":"Facebook's branch of apache thrift","body":"FBThrift: Facebook's branch of apache thrift\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe main focus of this package is the new C++ server, under thrift/lib/cpp2.  This repo also contains a branch of the rest of apache thrift's repo with any changes Facebook has made, however the build system only supports cpp2.\r\n\r\nApache thrift is at http://thrift.apache.org/\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n--------\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\n - Facebook's folly library: http://www.github.com/facebook/folly\r\n\r\n - In addition to the packages required for building folly, Ubuntu 13.10 and \r\n   14.04 require the following packages (feel free to cut and paste the apt-get\r\n   command below):\r\n\r\n```\r\n  sudo apt-get install \\\r\n      flex \\\r\n      bison \\\r\n      libkrb5-dev \\\r\n      libsasl2-dev \\\r\n      libnuma-dev \\\r\n      pkg-config \\\r\n      libssl-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor your convenience, a build script is provided for ubuntu 12.10 64-bit:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncd fbthrift/thrift\r\n./deps.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will automatically pull down folly and build it, and then configure and build thrift.\r\n\r\n - Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit requires the following packages:\r\n\r\n    - autoconf\r\n    - libtool\r\n    - g++\r\n    - libboost-dev-all\r\n    - libevent-dev\r\n    - flex\r\n    - bison\r\n    - libgoogle-glog-dev\r\n    - scons\r\n    - libkrb5-dev\r\n    - libsnappy-dev\r\n    - libsasl2-dev\r\n\r\nDocs\r\n----\r\n\r\nSome docs on the new cpp2 server are at:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/fbthrift/blob/master/thrift/doc/Cpp2.md\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
